# Real Time Bus Tracker MBTA
Portfolio Ready | MIT Full Stack Course Week 9

#### Description:
This is a bus tracker that shows the location, in real-time, of busses traveling north or south along the MBTA's (Massachessetts Bay Transportation Authority) Route 1 which travels between Harvard and MIT's campuses. This app was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Google Fonts, an API Key for Google Maps and an open API from the MBTA.



#### How To Run:
Fork and copy "index.html" and download to your local machine. The "index.html" file will require any user to enter their own Google Maps API Key in the location noted in the file.



#### Road Map To Future Improvements:
I plan to add more styling to the page with Bootstrap and additional fonts. I'd like to create a grid layout with images and notable locations along the route at which point I can add a secure API key.
